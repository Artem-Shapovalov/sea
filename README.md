# Motivation

This project goal is make your development as a vacation on seashore.

Lots of the projects have the common pain point - overcomplicated tooling. Frequently, complexity of build scripts, testing, or development environment deploying higher than the code itself. Also, I noticed that most of the project I've seen are pretty simple, but developers in their intention to rationalize, automate or bring their own beauty. Such actions without a real reason lead to suffer, and frequently financial losses.

This project is not aimed to solve all developers problems, but lots of them.

# Current status

Demo is done, people interested in, so I decided to continue this project. The current stage is preparing plans for the first release.

# Current features

- Automatically builds the files in the current directory without a single line of the build script.

- CLI user interface to use the Sea in your CI/CD pipelines.

- Interactive textual user interface, pretty simple and convenient, you don't need to learn lots of languages or tooling.
